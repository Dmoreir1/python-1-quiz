# n `pb1.py`, create a function that `replace_spaces` that accepts two inputs:
# - A string that represents a sentence
# - The punctuation character that will replace the spaces in the sentence


# def replace_spaces(sentence, punc):
#     sentence = sentence.replace("", punc)
#
#     return sentence
#







# sentence = "Test  This is a test   Testing "
# # sentence2 = pb1.replace_spaces(sentence, "_")
# print(sentence2) # -> Test__This_is_a_test__Testing_
